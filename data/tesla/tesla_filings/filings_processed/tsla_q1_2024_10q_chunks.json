Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\n\nOur provision for or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.\n\n*Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders*\n\n    The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\n\n\n[TABLE]\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>2024</th><th>2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Net income attributable to common stockholders</td><td>$ 1,129</td><td>$ 2,513</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest</td><td>(42)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td>Net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock</td><td>$ 1,171</td><td>$ 2,518</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n",

Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, government rebates receivable was $572 million and $378 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and $45 million and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n*Financing Receivables*\n\n    As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for expected credit losses was $36 million.\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in U.S. government securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities and money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\n\n*Supply Risk*\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\n[TABLE]\nWarranties\n\nAccrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"2\">Three Months Ended March 31,</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>2024</th><th>2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Accrued warranty\u2014beginning of period</td><td>$        5,152</td><td>$        3,505</td></tr><tr><td>Warranty costs incurred</td><td>(328)</td><td>(280)</td></tr><tr><td>Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact</td><td>(18)</td><td>208</td></tr><tr><td>Provision for warranty</td><td>547</td><td>532</td></tr><tr><td>Accrued warranty\u2014end of period</td><td>$        5,353</td><td>$        3,965</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n",

    "text": "Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\n    In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment\u2019s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60). This ASU requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet and in the income statement each reporting period. This ASU also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the ASU is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the ASU as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. This ASU will result in gains and losses recorded in the consolidated financial statements of operations and additional disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the adoption of this ASU and it could materially affect the carrying value of our crypto assets held and the gains and losses relating thereto, depending on the fair value at adoption.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity\u2019s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.\n\nNote 2 \u2013 Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n    ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (\u201cASC 820\u201d) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):",

The increase in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of releasing the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023 and changes in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings.\n\nOur effective tax rates for the first three months of 2024 and 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the mix of our jurisdictional earnings subject to different tax rates, impact of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, as well as benefits from our U.S. tax credits and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cIRA\u201d) manufacturing credits.\n\nWe are subject to tax examinations in the U.S. federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions.

Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing and argument are now complete. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion ordering rescission of Mr. Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation plan. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel have filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla\u2019s opposition to the fee request is due on June 7, 2024, and a hearing is scheduled for July 8, 2024. On April 17, 2024, Tesla filed a preliminary proxy statement which included a number of proposals, including a proposal to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\n\n*Litigation Related to Directors\u2019 Compensation*\n\n    On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\u2019s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla\u2019s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\n\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels\u2019 fee request under advisement.

    "text": "_Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction_\n\n        Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk\u2019s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On July 14, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.\n\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action.\n\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company\u2019s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until June 3, 2024.\n\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (\u201cJP Morgan\u201d) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk\u2019s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan\u2019s adjustment as a violation of the parties\u2019 agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court.",

    "text": "_Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment_\n\nOn October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla\u2019s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. A retrial was held starting on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $3,175,000. As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from an initial $136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $3.175 million (April 3, 2023). On November 2, 2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on November 16, 2023, Tesla filed a notice of cross appeal. In March 2024, the parties reached a confidential settlement resolving all claims in this matter.\n\nOn February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (\u201cCRD,\u201d formerly \u201cDFEH\u201d) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD\u2019s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is currently in discovery. Trial is scheduled for October 14, 2024.\n\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD\u2019s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. On December 18, 2023, Tesla filed a motion to stay the case. Separately, on December 26, 2023, Tesla filed a motion to dismiss the case. Both motions were subsequently denied.\n\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\u2019s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys\u2019 fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on September 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an amended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, which the Court granted on April 12, 2024, with leave for the Plaintiffs to amend.",

On October 5, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term \u201cFull Self-Driving Capability\u201d (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company\u2019s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12, 2023, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court\u2019s arbitration order, which was denied.\n\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.",

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n    The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nOverview\n\n        Our mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on AI, robotics and automation.\n\nIn 2024, we produced approximately 433,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 387,000 consumer vehicles through the first quarter. We are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more affordable products, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, further improving and deploying our FSD capabilities, including through our planned robotaxi product, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\n\nIn 2024, we deployed 4.05 GWh of energy storage products through the first quarter. We are focused on ramping the production and increasing the market penetration of our energy storage products.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recognized total revenues of $21.30 billion, representing a decrease of $2.03 billion, compared to the prior year. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.13 billion, representing an unfavorable change of $1.38 billion, compared to the same period in the prior year. We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing capacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software, and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.\n\nWe ended the first quarter of 2024 with $26.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing a decrease of $2.23 billion from the end of 2023. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $242 million and $2.51 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $2.27 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $2.77 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.07 billion during the same period ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $701 million. Overall growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and development in upcoming periods.\n\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 Outlook\n\n*Automotive\u2014Production*\n\n        The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q:\n\n\n[TABLE]\n<table><thead><tr><th>Production Location</th><th>Vehicle Model(s)</th><th>Production Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fremont Factory</td><td>Model S / Model X</td><td>Active</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Model 3 / Model Y</td><td>Active</td></tr><tr><td>Gigafactory Shanghai</td><td>Model 3 / Model Y</td><td>Active</td></tr><tr><td>Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg</td><td>Model Y</td><td>Active</td></tr><tr><td>Gigafactory Texas</td><td>Model Y</td><td>Active</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cybertruck</td><td>Active</td></tr><tr><td>Gigafactory Nevada</td><td>Tesla Semi</td><td>Pilot production</td></tr><tr><td>Various</td><td>Next Generation Platform</td><td>In development</td></tr><tr><td>TBD</td><td>Roadster</td><td>In development</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and future vehicles utilizing aspects of our next generation platform, and ramping the production at our Gigafactories to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.",

    "text": "These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the first quarter of 2024, we experienced a sequential decline in production volumes partially caused by the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\n\n*Automotive\u2014Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure*\n\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles\u2019 affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles\u2019 performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\n\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers\u2019 liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth.\n\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (\u201cNACS\u201d) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.",

    "text": "_Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment_\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the construction of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our Megafactory in Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products.\n\n*Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends*\n\n        Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously developing and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be between $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\n\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap, invest in autonomy and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nFor a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, _Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates_ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n        See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n\n[TABLE]\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\n<table><thead><tr><th rowspan=\"2\">(Dollars in millions)</th><th colspan=\"2\">Three Months Ended March 31,</th><th colspan=\"2\">Change</th></tr><tr><th>2024</th><th>2023</th><th>$</th><th>%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Automotive sales</td><td>$ 16,460</td><td>$ 18,878</td><td>$ (2,418)</td><td>(13)%</td></tr><tr><td>Automotive regulatory credits</td><td>442</td><td>521</td><td>(79)</td><td>(15)%</td></tr><tr><td>Automotive leasing</td><td>476</td><td>564</td><td>(88)</td><td>(16)%</td></tr><tr><td>Total automotive revenues</td><td>17,378</td><td>19,963</td><td>(2,585)</td><td>(13)%</td></tr><tr><td>Services and other</td><td>2,288</td><td>1,837</td><td>451</td><td>25 %</td></tr><tr><td>Total automotive & services and other segment revenue</td><td>19,666</td><td>21,800</td><td>(2,134)</td><td>(10)%</td></tr><tr><td>Energy generation and storage segment revenue</td><td>1,635</td><td>1,529</td><td>106</td><td>7 %</td></tr><tr><td>Total revenues</td><td>$ 21,301</td><td>$ 23,329</td><td>$ (2,028)</td><td>(9)%</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n*Automotive & Services and Other Segment*\n\nAutomotive sales revenue decreased $2.42 billion, or 13%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions year over year. Additionally, there was a decrease of approximately 27,000 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately 7,000 deliveries of other models as we ramped our production of Cybertruck.",

The increase was primarily due to an increase in average selling price of Megapack partially offset by a decrease in solar deployments.\n\n\n[TABLE]\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"2\">Three Months Ended March 31,</th><th colspan=\"2\">Change</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>2024</th><th>2023</th><th>$</th><th>%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cost of revenues</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Automotive sales</td><td>$ 13,897</td><td>$ 15,422</td><td>$ (1,525)</td><td>(10)%</td></tr><tr><td>Automotive leasing</td><td>269</td><td>333</td><td>(64)</td><td>(19)%</td></tr><tr><td>Total automotive cost of revenues</td><td>14,166</td><td>15,755</td><td>(1,589)</td><td>(10)%</td></tr><tr><td>Services and other</td><td>2,207</td><td>1,702</td><td>505</td><td>30 %</td></tr><tr><td>Total automotive & services and other segment cost of revenues</td><td>16,373</td><td>17,457</td><td>(1,084)</td><td>(6)%</td></tr><tr><td>Energy generation and storage segment</td><td>1,232</td><td>1,361</td><td>(129)</td><td>(9)%</td></tr><tr><td>Total cost of revenues</td><td>$ 17,605</td><td>$ 18,818</td><td>$ (1,213)</td><td>(6)%</td></tr><tr><td>Gross profit total automotive</td><td>$ 3,212</td><td>$ 4,208</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross margin total automotive</td><td>18.5 %</td><td>21.1 %</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment</td><td>$ 3,293</td><td>$ 4,343</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment</td><td>16.7 %</td><td>19.9 %</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross profit energy generation and storage segment</td><td>$ 403</td><td>$ 168</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross margin energy generation and storage segment</td><td>24.6 %</td><td>11.0 %</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total gross profit</td><td>$ 3,696</td><td>$ 4,511</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total gross margin</td><td>17.4 %</td><td>19.3 %</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n*Automotive & Services and Other Segment*\n\n    Cost of automotive sales revenue decreased $1.53 billion, or 10%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cost of automotive sales revenue decreased due to a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily from lower raw material costs, freight and duties in addition to the changes in deliveries year over year as discussed. Additionally, there were higher costs for Cybertruck and the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory as a result of the temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity as production ramps.\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $64 million, or 19%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

    "text": "Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n        We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last five fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\n\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\n\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following March 31, 2024, as well as in the long-term.\n\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs.\n\n*Material Cash Requirements*\n\n    From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\n\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part I, Item 2, _Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 Outlook\u2014Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends_ in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be between $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. We also have certain obligations in connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York and Gigafactory Shanghai, as outlined in Part II, Item 7, _Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014Material Cash Requirements_ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.90 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $2.14 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, *Debt*, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n_Sources and Conditions of Liquidity_\n\n        Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products, interest income, and proceeds from debt facilities and equity offerings, when applicable.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $11.81 billion and $15.06 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $3.47 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan and euros. We had $5.00 billion of unused committed credit amounts as of March 31, 2024.

We also purchased $2.31 billion and $411 million of short-term investments, net of proceeds from maturities, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n*Cash Flows from Financing Activities*\n\nNet cash from financing activities changed by $429 million to $196 million net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $233 million net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The change was primarily due to a $776 million increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, partially offset by a $289 million increase in repayments of debt and a $94 million increase in payments for buy-outs of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. See Note 7, *Debt*, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding our debt obligations.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\n        We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\n\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).\n\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $431 million at March 31, 2024 and $1.01 billion at December 31, 2023, assuming no foreign currency hedging.",

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n*Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting*\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nPART II.
