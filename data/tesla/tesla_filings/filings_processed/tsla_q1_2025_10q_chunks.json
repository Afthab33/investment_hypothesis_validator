Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606, *Revenue from Contracts with Customers*.\n\nWe receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual or determined residual value at the end of the lease term.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company\u2019s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\n\nOur provision for income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.\n\n*Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders*\n\n    The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\n\n\n[TABLE]\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"2\">Three Months Ended March 31,</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>2025</th><th>2024</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Net income attributable to common stockholders (1)</td><td>$ 409</td><td>$ 1,390</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Buy-outs of noncontrolling interest</td><td>\u2014</td><td>(42)</td></tr><tr><td>Net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock</td><td>$ 409</td><td>$ 1,432</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n(1)    As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2023-08, *Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets*, the previously reported quarterly period in 2024 has been recast.

Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, government rebates receivable was $232 million and $315 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and immaterial amounts in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n*Financing Receivables*\n\n     As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due.

These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\n\n*Supply Risk*\n\n    We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\n[TABLE]\nWarranties\n\nAccrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"2\">Three Months Ended March 31,</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>2025</th><th>2024</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Accrued warranty - beginning of period</td><td>$ 6,716</td><td>$ 5,152</td></tr><tr><td>Warranty costs incurred</td><td>(392)</td><td>(328)</td></tr><tr><td>Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact</td><td>347</td><td>(18)</td></tr><tr><td>Provision for warranty</td><td>543</td><td>547</td></tr><tr><td>Accrued warranty - end of period</td><td>$ 7,214</td><td>$ 5,353</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740).

We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) (\u201cnew crypto assets standard\u201d). The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2024. As such, the previously reported consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 have been recast to reflect the adoption of the new crypto assets standard. The following table presents the effects of these changes on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements:\n\n\n[TABLE]\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited):\n<table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"4\">As of March 31, 2024</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>As Previously Reported</th><th>Adjustments from Adoption of the New Crypto Assets Standard</th><th>As Adjusted</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th colspan=\"4\">Assets</th></tr><tr><td>Digital assets, net</td><td>$ 184</td><td>$ 638</td><td>$ 822</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax assets</td><td>$ 6,769</td><td>$ (141)</td><td>$ 6,628</td></tr><tr><th colspan=\"4\">Stockholders' equity</th></tr><tr><td>Retained earnings</td><td>$ 29,011</td><td>$ 497</td><td>$ 29,508</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n\n[TABLE]\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited):\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"3\">Three Months Ended March 31, 2024</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>As Previously Reported</th><th>Adjustments from Adoption of the New Crypto Assets Standard</th><th>As Adjusted</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Other income (expense), net</td><td>$ 108</td><td>$ 335</td><td>$ 443</td></tr><tr><td>Provision for income taxes</td><td>$ 409</td><td>$ 74</td><td>$ 483</td></tr><tr><td>Net income attributable to common stockholders</td><td>$ 1,129</td><td>$ 261</td><td>$ 1,390</td></tr><tr><td>Net income per share attributable to common stockholders:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>    Basic</td><td>$ 0.37</td><td>$ 0.08</td><td>$ 0.45</td></tr><tr><td>    Diluted</td><td>$ 0.34</td><td>$ 0.07</td><td>$ 0.41</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nNote 2 \u2013 Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n        ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (\u201cASC 820\u201d) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.

Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla\u2019s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72% of the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because Tesla\u2019s disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Musk and the other director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024, the Court issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion and awarded Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of $345 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court, and the director defendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court. Tesla and the Director Defendants filed their response briefs on March 11, 2025. Plaintiff\u2019s opening brief is due on April 25, 2025, and reply briefs are due on May 16, 2025. If the appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court were unsuccessful, it could result in a material adverse impact on our business and reported earnings due to the uncertainty and potentially significant costs associated with replacing or revising Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation package, the types of which were described in our 2024 proxy statement.\n\n*Litigation Related to Directors\u2019 Compensation*\n\n     On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\u2019s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla\u2019s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\n\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees request under advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of approximately $176 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025.\n\nThe Company disagrees with the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded by the court. On February 10, 2025, Tesla appealed the attorneys\u2019 fee award amount to the Delaware Supreme Court. Tesla did not appeal the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s approval of the underlying settlement. Also on February 10, 2025, a single shareholder appealed the approval of the settlement. This shareholder\u2019s appeal does not seek to alter any material terms (e.g., financial contributions or the defendants\u2019 obligations under the Settlement Agreement). The Delaware Court of Chancery had previously rejected this shareholder\u2019s objections when approving the Settlement Agreement.\n\nBecause neither Tesla\u2019s appeal nor the shareholder\u2019s appeal seeks to vacate the Settlement Agreement or materially modify its terms, the Company expects to implement the provisions of the Settlement Agreement in May 2025 by cancelling the options requiring cancellation under its terms.",

    "text": "In connection with the settlement, Tesla received $277 million from certain directors and paid Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees of $176 million (which, as noted above, the Company is appealing) in the three months ended March 31, 2025. We have recorded a $31 million reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense in association with the returned awards and increased our provision for income taxes in relation to the return of directors\u2019 compensation. As the settlement was an equity transaction, the net impact to additional paid-in-capital was $110 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025.\n\n_Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction_\n\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Several of those actions were consolidated, and all have been stayed. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated.\n\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company\u2019s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees. The lawsuit has been stayed.\n\n_Certain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware_\n\n     Before converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three separate derivative actions brought by purported Tesla stockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against current and former directors regarding topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and x.AI. These suits assert various claims, including breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified damages and other relief. On August 6, 2024, the plaintiffs in these three actions moved to consolidate the matters into a single case. The Court consolidated two of the three cases. Tesla and the directors filed motions to dismiss on April 4, 2025.\n\n_Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment_\n\n    On February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (\u201cCRD,\u201d formerly \u201cDFEH\u201d) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD\u2019s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in discovery. Trial is scheduled for September 15, 2025.\n\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD\u2019s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief.",

    "text": "Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\n\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other consumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company\u2019s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a proposed class complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint and entered judgment for Tesla. On September 5, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and oral argument occurred on March 20, 2025. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term \u201cFull Self-Driving Capability\u201d (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla\u2019s motion. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on June 27, 2024, the Court stayed the case pending arbitration.\n\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company\u2019s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019, and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. On November 26, 2024, the court issued a final judgment in Tesla\u2019s favor, and on December 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.",

    "text": "On March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints were also filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12, 2023, which Tesla moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court\u2019s arbitration order, which was denied. On June 17, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint. On February 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint that removed the claims for monetary damages.\n\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\n\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\n\n        We regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations, technology (e.g., vehicle functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla\u2019s business, its personnel, and related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\n\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\n\nNote 11 \u2013 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\n\n    The aggregate carrying values of the variable interest entities\u2019 assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\n\n\n[TABLE]\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>March 31, 2025</th><th>December 31, 2024</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current assets</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>$ 47</td><td>$ 49</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts receivable, net</td><td>20</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Prepaid expenses and other current assets</td><td>288</td><td>276</td></tr><tr><td>Total current assets</td><td>355</td><td>343</td></tr><tr><td>Operating lease vehicles, net</td><td>358</td><td>392</td></tr><tr><td>Solar energy systems, net</td><td>2,273</td><td>2,310</td></tr><tr><td>Other non-current assets</td><td>184</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$ 3,170</td><td>$ 3,228</td></tr><tr><td>Liabilities</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current liabilities</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accrued liabilities and other</td><td>$ 22</td><td>$ 32</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred revenue</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Current portion of debt and finance leases</td><td>1,946</td><td>2,114</td></tr><tr><td>Total current liabilities</td><td>1,974</td><td>2,152</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred revenue, net of current portion</td><td>67</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Debt and finance leases, net of current portion</td><td>1,450</td><td>1,834</td></tr><tr><td>Total liabilities</td><td>$ 3,491</td><td>$ 4,057</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n",

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n*The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.*\n\nOverview\n\n        Our mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on AI, robotics and automation.\n\nAs a result of rapidly evolving trade policy, uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase, posing risks to our global supply chain and cost structure which could have a meaningfully adverse impact on demand for our products and our profitability. The current tariff regime will have a relatively larger impact on our energy generation and storage business compared to our automotive business. While we prepare for near-term challenges to our business under current policies, we are focused on long-term growth opportunities as we continue to make prudent investments.\n\nIn 2025, we produced approximately 363,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 337,000 consumer vehicles through the first quarter. We are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more affordable products, further improving and deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous capabilities through our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab, reducing costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\n\nIn 2025, we deployed 10.4 GWh of energy storage products through the first quarter. We are focused on ramping the production and increasing the market penetration of our energy storage products.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recognized total revenues of $19.34 billion, representing a decrease of $1.97 billion compared to the same period in the prior year. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $409 million, representing a decrease of $981 million compared to the same period in the prior year. We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing capacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software, and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.",

In the first quarter of 2025, we accomplished an industry first - simultaneously changing over production lines across all factories for our New Model Y. While there were several weeks of lost production in the quarter from this changeover, we successfully ramped our production lines across four factories while managing supply chains across three continents without any major disruptions, demonstrating the advancement of our operational and supply chain management capabilities. As we continue to ramp production of the New Model Y, we are also preparing our factories for the launch of new models later this year. The next phase of production growth will be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\n\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, changes to trade policy with respect to tariffs, export controls and other restrictions may impact our global supply chain cost structure and availability, affecting not only vehicle production, but also facility expansions. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory expansion.\n\n*Automotive\u2014Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure*\n\n        Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles\u2019 affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles\u2019 performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features utilizing artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and delivering new vehicles and vehicle options, such as our launch of the updated Model 3 in 2024, and the New Model Y in the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.",

    "text": "However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to shifting consumer trends, political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, as inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which impacted the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers\u2019 liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin.\n\nChanges in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, cost structure and the competitive landscape. While the final scope and application of recently announced changes in trade policy remain uncertain at this time, higher tariffs on imports and subsequent retaliatory tariffs could adversely impact consumer spending and demand for durable goods and related services. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction efforts, including through production innovation, process improvements and logistics optimization, and focus on operating leverage, vertical integration and supply chain localization will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors. Our new products, which will include more affordable options, and our advances in autonomy, position us for future growth.\n\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (\u201cNACS\u201d) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\n\n*Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment*\n\n        The long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production and capabilities of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the introduction of Powerwall 3 in 2024, and the ramps of our Megafactories in Shanghai and Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones and logistics. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products. At the same time, changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. For instance, the recently announced import tariffs by the US government could significantly increase battery cell expenses, negatively impacting consumer demand. Despite these challenges, as AI infrastructure drives rapid load growth, we see opportunities for our energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.",

    "text": "Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\n    Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions and shifting global trade policy. We are simultaneously developing and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. While we prepare for near-term challenges to our business under current policies, we are focused on long-term growth opportunities as we continue to make critical, high-value investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2025. Changes in trade policy may necessitate adjustments to our project timelines, potentially impacting our capital expenditure expectations.\n\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to invest in autonomy, further vertically integrate our supply chain, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\n     For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, _Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates_ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

    "text": "Cash Flows from Investing Activities\n\n     Net cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $1.49 billion and $2.78 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, mainly for AI-related capital expenditures, global factory expansion, machinery and equipment as we expand and enhance our product roadmap. We also purchased $159 million and $2.31 billion of short-term investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\n     Net cash flows from financing activities changed by $528 million to $332 million net cash outflows during the three months ended March 31, 2025 from $196 million net cash inflows during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a $710 million increase in repayments of debt and a $151 million decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt. See Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding our debt obligations. Additionally, the decrease was partially offset by a $101 million decrease in payments for buy-outs of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and $101 million of proceeds received from directors in shareholder settlement net of payment for related legal fees during the three months ended March 31, 2025.\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\n        We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\n\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).\n\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.14 billion at March 31, 2025 and $1.15 billion at December 31, 2024, assuming no foreign currency hedging.",

    "text": "ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\n     Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n*Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting*\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2025, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nPART II.

    "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\n        Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and future results. Other than the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report.\n\n*We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax, tariff, export controls and labor conditions.*\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales. We have little control over these matters which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., with and without manufacturing operations in China and Europe, create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating U.S. and foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Further, the United States has recently announced changes to U.S. trade policy, including increasing tariffs on imports, in many cases significantly, and potentially renegotiating or terminating existing trade agreements. The exact scope of any such tariffs that will ultimately be implemented is not known at this time, and the impacts on our business and costs of our products is uncertain. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. exports, further increases in U.S. tariffs, and the uncertainties surrounding domestic and foreign tariffs could also adversely impact demand for our products. We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements, such as those with China, or whether, or to what extent, quotas, duties, additional tariffs, export controls or other restrictions will be changed or imposed by the United States or by other countries. Historically, past U.S. special tariff actions have increased our costs for vehicles manufactured in the United States and increased costs for those same vehicles when exported from the United States. Further, as it pertains to electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries for our energy storage products, while the Company has continuously aimed for a strong domestic supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the United States. A change on any of these conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results if we are unable to manage them effectively.",

Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla\u2019s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team, and has incited protests, some escalating to violence targeting our operations, products and personnel. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our brand and our business (including sales) and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\n\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n\n        None of the Company\u2019s directors or officers adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company\u2019s fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n\n        The Board has not yet established the date of the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders. When the date is established, the Company will announce it in its filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n        Additionally, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors has established a Special Committee to consider certain compensation matters involving Mr. Musk.",
