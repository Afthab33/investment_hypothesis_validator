Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606, *Revenue from Contracts with Customers*.\n\nWe receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual or determined residual value at the end of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these programs to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee liabilities. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were immaterial as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual residual value at the end of the lease term was $2.46 billion and $1.45 billion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\n\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\n\n    As of June 30, 2025, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.47 billion.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company\u2019s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\n\nOur provision for income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.\n\n*Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders*\n\n    The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\n\n\n[TABLE]\n<table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"1\"></th><th colspan=\"2\">Three Months Ended June 30,</th><th colspan=\"2\">Six Months Ended June 30,</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>2025</th><th>2024</th><th>2025</th><th>2024</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Net income attributable to common stockholders (1)</td><td>$ 1,172</td><td>$ 1,400</td><td>$ 1,581</td><td>$ 2,790</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Buy-outs of noncontrolling interest</td><td>\u2014</td><td>\u2014</td><td>\u2014</td><td>(42)</td></tr><tr><td>Net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock</td><td>$ 1,172</td><td>$ 1,400</td><td>$ 1,581</td><td>$ 2,832</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n(1)  As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2023-08, _Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets_, the previously reported periods in 2024 have been recast.

Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period.

As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the allowance for expected credit losses was $33 million.\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\n\n*Supply Risk*\n\n    We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n\n[TABLE]\nWarranties\n\nAccrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"2\">Three Months Ended June 30,</th><th colspan=\"2\">Six Months Ended June 30,</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>2025</th><th>2024</th><th>2025</th><th>2024</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Accrued warranty - beginning of period</td><td>$ 7,214</td><td>$ 5,353</td><td>$ 6,716</td><td>$ 5,152</td></tr><tr><td>Warranty costs incurred</td><td>(398)</td><td>(340)</td><td>(790)</td><td>(668)</td></tr><tr><td>Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact</td><td>105</td><td>72</td><td>452</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Provision for warranty</td><td>591</td><td>710</td><td>1,134</td><td>1,260</td></tr><tr><td>Accrued warranty - end of period</td><td>$ 7,512</td><td>$ 5,795</td><td>$ 7,512</td><td>$ 5,795</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n",

    "text": "In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity\u2019s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements on either a prospective or retrospective basis, once adopted.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40). The ASU requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses along with the definition of selling expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Adoption of this ASU can either be applied prospectively to consolidated financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU.\n\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. H.R.1, an act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14. (\u201cthe OBBBA\u201d) was enacted. The OBBBA introduces multiple tax law and other legislative changes, including modifications to income tax provisions such as domestic research and development expenses, capital expenditures, and U.S. taxation of international earnings; the repeal or acceleration of the sunset of certain tax credits under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and elimination of certain penalties for violations of certain regulatory credit programs. We are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions on our consolidated financial statements, including loss of certain regulatory credit sales tied to our products and changes to the costs of our products.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) (\u201cnew crypto assets standard\u201d). The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2024. As such, the previously reported consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 have been recast to reflect the adoption of the new crypto assets standard.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data.

The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the changes in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings.\n\nOur effective tax rates for the first three and six months of 2025 and 2024 as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% were primarily impacted by the mix of our jurisdictional earnings subject to different tax rates, valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets and benefits from our U.S. research and development credits, and manufacturing production credits.\n\nNote 10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nOperating Lease Arrangements in Buffalo, New York and Shanghai, China\n\n     For a description of our operating lease arrangements in Buffalo, New York, and Shanghai, China, refer to Note 14, _Commitments and Contingencies_, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under these arrangements, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\n     On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018 (the \u201c2018 CEO Performance Award\u201d). Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla\u2019s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72% of the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because Tesla\u2019s disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Musk and the other director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024, the Court issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion and awarded Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of $345 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court, and the director defendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court. Tesla and the Director Defendants filed their response briefs on March 11, 2025. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief on April 25, 2025, and reply briefs were filed on May 16, 2025. Therefore, the appeal has been fully briefed, but an oral argument date has not yet been set. If the appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court were unsuccessful, it could result in a material adverse impact on our business and reported earnings due to the uncertainty and potentially significant costs associated with replacing or revising Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation package, the types of which were described in our 2024 proxy statement.\n\n_Litigation Related to Directors\u2019 Compensation_\n\n     On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\u2019s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla\u2019s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.",

    "text": "On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees request under advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of approximately $176 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025.\n\nThe Company disagrees with the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded by the court. On February 10, 2025, Tesla appealed the attorneys\u2019 fee award amount to the Delaware Supreme Court. Tesla did not appeal the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s approval of the underlying settlement. Also on February 10, 2025, a single shareholder appealed the approval of the settlement. This shareholder\u2019s appeal does not seek to alter any material terms (e.g., financial contributions or the defendants\u2019 obligations under the Settlement Agreement). The Delaware Court of Chancery had previously rejected this shareholder\u2019s objections when approving the Settlement Agreement. Tesla\u2019s appeal of the attorneys\u2019 fee award and the single shareholder\u2019s appeal have been fully briefed. An oral argument date has not yet been set.\n\nBecause neither Tesla\u2019s appeal nor the shareholder\u2019s appeal seeks to vacate the Settlement Agreement or materially modify its terms, the Company implemented the provisions of the Settlement Agreement in May 2025 by cancelling the options requiring cancellation under its terms.\n\nIn connection with the settlement, Tesla received $277 million from certain directors and paid Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees of $176 million (which, as noted above, the Company is appealing) in the three months ended March 31, 2025. We have recorded a $31 million reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense in association with the returned awards and increased our provision for income taxes in relation to the return of directors\u2019 compensation. As the settlement was an equity transaction, the net impact to additional paid-in-capital was $110 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025.\n\n_Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction_\n\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Several of those actions were consolidated, and all have been stayed. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases were also consolidated, and on April 25, 2025, were dismissed with prejudice through a stipulation and order.\n\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company\u2019s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company\u2019s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees. The lawsuit has been stayed.",

    "text": "*Certain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware*\n\n     Before converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three separate derivative actions brought by purported Tesla stockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against current and former directors regarding topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and x.AI. These suits assert various claims, including breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified damages and other relief. On August 6, 2024, the plaintiffs in these three actions moved to consolidate the matters into a single case. The Court consolidated two of the three cases. Tesla and the directors filed motions to dismiss on April 4, 2025. On June 10, 2025, the plaintiffs in the consolidated cases filed an opposition, and on that same date, the plaintiff in the case that was not consolidated filed an amended complaint.\n\n_Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment_\n\n    On February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (\u201cCRD,\u201d formerly \u201cDFEH\u201d) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD\u2019s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in discovery. No trial date is set but is expected to occur during 2026.\n\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD\u2019s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. The case is in discovery with no trial date set.",

    "text": "Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\n\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other consumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company\u2019s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint and entered judgment for Tesla. On September 30, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and oral argument occurred on March 20, 2025. On April 25, 2025, the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court\u2019s order and dismissed the case. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term \u201cFull Self-Driving Capability\u201d (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of the plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiffs in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla\u2019s motion. On May 6, 2025, the plaintiff filed a motion for class certification, which has been fully briefed, and a hearing is scheduled for August 12, 2025. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on June 27, 2024, the Court stayed the case pending arbitration.\n\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company\u2019s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019, and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. On November 26, 2024, the court issued a final judgment in Tesla\u2019s favor, and on December 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeal has been fully briefed, and the parties are awaiting a date for oral argument.",

    "text": "On March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints were also filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12, 2023, which Tesla moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court\u2019s arbitration order, which was denied. On June 17, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint. On February 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint that removed the claims for monetary damages. On June 9, 2025, pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulated motion, the court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\n\n*Certain Investigations and Other Matters*\n\n        We regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations, technology (e.g., vehicle functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and FSD Capability and Robotaxi), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla\u2019s business, its personnel, and related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\n\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and worked with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\n\n\n[TABLE]\nNote 11 \u2013 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\n\nThe aggregate carrying values of the variable interest entities' assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\n\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>June 30, 2025</th><th>December 31, 2024</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current assets</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>$ 59</td><td>$ 49</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts receivable, net</td><td>27</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Prepaid expenses and other current assets</td><td>250</td><td>276</td></tr><tr><td>Total current assets</td><td>336</td><td>343</td></tr><tr><td>Operating lease vehicles, net</td><td>340</td><td>392</td></tr><tr><td>Solar energy systems, net</td><td>2,241</td><td>2,310</td></tr><tr><td>Other non-current assets</td><td>191</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$ 3,108</td><td>$ 3,228</td></tr><tr><td>Liabilities</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current liabilities</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accrued liabilities and other</td><td>$ 35</td><td>$ 32</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred revenue</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Current portion of debt and finance leases</td><td>1,748</td><td>2,114</td></tr><tr><td>Total current liabilities</td><td>1,789</td><td>2,152</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred revenue, net of current portion</td><td>63</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Debt and finance leases, net of current portion</td><td>1,422</td><td>1,834</td></tr><tr><td>Total liabilities</td><td>$ 3,274</td><td>$ 4,057</td></tr></tbody></table>\n[/TABLE]\n",

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n    The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nOverview\n\n        Our mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on AI, robotics and automation.\n\nAs a result of rapidly evolving trade and fiscal policy, uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase, posing risks to our global supply chain and cost structure which could have a meaningfully adverse impact on demand for our products and our profitability. The current tariff regime will have a relatively larger impact on our energy generation and storage business compared to our automotive business. While we prepare for near-term challenges to our business under current policies, we are focused on long-term growth opportunities as we continue to make prudent investments.\n\nIn 2025, we produced approximately 773,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 721,000 consumer vehicles through the second quarter. We are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more affordable products and services, further improving and deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous capabilities through our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab, reducing costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing our vehicles, battery and AI compute technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure. In June 2025, we launched our Robotaxi service in Austin, capitalizing on our AI investments and scalable mobility infrastructure to advance a service-driven business model.\n\nIn 2025, we deployed 20.0 GWh of energy storage products through the second quarter. We are focused on ramping the production, increasing the market penetration of our energy storage products, developing our battery technologies and vertically integrating, localizing and expanding our supply chain.",

Our factories are also preparing for the release of new models later this year. The next phase of production growth will be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to manufacture our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\n\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, changes to fiscal and trade policy with respect to tariffs, export controls and other restrictions may impact our global supply chain cost structure and availability, affecting not only vehicle production, but also facility expansions. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles.\n\n*Automotive\u2014Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure*\n\n     Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles\u2019 affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles\u2019 performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features utilizing artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and delivering new vehicles and vehicle options. In addition, we believe the launch of our Robotaxi service in June 2025 will unlock significant business growth to advance a service-driven business model. We will continue to improve safety and profitability while scaling the network. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.",

    "text": "However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to shifting consumer trends, political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, as inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which impacted the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers\u2019 liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin.\n\nChanges in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, cost structure and the competitive landscape. While the final scope and application of recently announced changes in trade policy remain uncertain at this time, higher tariffs on imports and subsequent retaliatory tariffs could adversely impact consumer spending and demand for durable goods and related services. Furthermore, certain provisions of the recently signed OBBBA, including the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles, may also impact consumer demand for electric vehicles in general once effective. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction efforts, including through production innovation, process improvements and logistics optimization, and focus on operating leverage, vertical integration and supply chain localization will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors. Our new products, which will include more affordable options, and our advances in autonomy, position us for future growth.\n\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (\u201cNACS\u201d) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. In tandem with the launch of our Robotaxi business, we are focused on developing and optimizing dedicated infrastructure, including in relation to vehicle cleaning and maintenance, charging, security, teleoperations and fleet management, to ensure service quality as we continue to scale.",

    "text": "Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\n    The long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production and capabilities of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the ramps of our Megafactories in Shanghai and Lathrop, California, and the construction of a new Megafactory near Houston, Texas. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones and logistics. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products. At the same time, changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. For instance, the recently announced import tariffs by the US government and the provisions of the OBBBA could significantly increase battery cell expenses and impact costs for our consumers, negatively impacting consumer demand. Despite these challenges, as AI infrastructure drives rapid load growth, we see opportunities for our energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.\n\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\n     Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions and shifting global trade and fiscal policy. We are simultaneously developing and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. While we prepare for near-term challenges to our business under current policies, we are focused on long-term growth opportunities as we continue to make critical, high-value investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $9.00 billion in 2025. Changes in fiscal and trade policy may necessitate adjustments to our project timelines, potentially impacting our cash flow and capital expenditure expectations.\n\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to invest in autonomy, further vertically integrate our supply chain, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\n     For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, _Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates_ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n        See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.",

    "text": "Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n        We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\n\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic, tax, trade or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\n\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following June 30, 2025, as well as in the long-term.\n\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs.\n\n*Material Cash Requirements*\n\n     From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\n\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part I, Item 2, _Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook\u2014Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends_ in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $9.00 billion in 2025. Changes in trade policy may necessitate adjustments to our project timelines, potentially impacting our capital expenditure expectations.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $6.98 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.97 billion is current. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, _Debt_, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\n*Sources and Conditions of Liquidity*\n\n     Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products, interest income, and proceeds from debt facilities and equity offerings, when applicable.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had $15.59 billion and $21.20 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $2.70 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan and euros. We had $5.00 billion of unused committed credit amounts as of June 30, 2025. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, _Debt_, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nWe continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments, investing in autonomy, further vertically integrating our supply chain, expanding our product roadmap and providing financing options to our customers.",

    "text": "ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\n        We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\n\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).\n\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.31 billion at June 30, 2025 and $1.15 billion at December 31, 2024, assuming no foreign currency hedging.\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n        Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\n*Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting*\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2025, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n     For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 10, *Commitments and Contingencies*, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\n        Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, _Risk Factors_ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and Part II, Item 1A, _Risk Factors_ in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and future results. Other than the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors discussed in our Annual and Quarterly Reports.\n\n*Demand for our products and services and our financial results may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products.*\n\nGovernment and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. Specifically, recent governmental and regulatory actions have repealed and/or restricted consumer, manufacturing and charging infrastructure tax credits, and certain regulatory credit programs tied to our products. These, and any similar actions in the future, may affect demand for our vehicles, and harm our growth, prospects and operating results, and the loss of previously available tax credits and carbon offset mechanisms may further negatively impact our financial results. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended to provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing modifications.\n\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning. For example, provisions of the OBBBA could affect battery cell expenses and impact costs for our consumers, negatively impacting demand. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.",
